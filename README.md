Genetic Algorithm Travelling Salesman Problem
Given a set of points and distance between every pair of points, the problem is to find the shortest path that visits every point exactly once and returns back to the starting point using the idea of Genetic Algorithm. In addition, also apply the Brute Force algoritm to compare the time between the two approach.
