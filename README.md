Genetic Algorithm Travelling Salesman Problem
Given a set of points and distance between every pair of points, the problem is to find the shortest path that visits every point exactly once and returns back to the starting point using the idea of Genetic Algorithm. In addition, also apply the Brute Force algorithm to compare the time between the two approaches.

Conclusion :

Brute Force - It checks every possible path, that is why it always guarantees to find the shortest path. It's easy and simple to implement this algorithm. This method is efficient when it's implemented to solve a subset of a large problem. However, it is very inefficient to solve problems of higher complexity. The reason why its inefficient is because it computes the factorial of a number. Imagine we have 20 points, and 20! is a huge number. Therefore, it will take a long time before it finds the best solution.

Genetic Algorithm - This algorithm is inspired by natural selection and evolutionary biology. It can also be easily implemented, as long as the fitness function and natural selection is properly implemented. It is fast and efficient to solve large problems. However, it may have more than one good solution. In addition, it may not guarantee the optimal solution.
